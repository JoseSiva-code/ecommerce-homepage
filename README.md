# Urban Style Ecommerce Homepage

Urban Style is a responsive ecommerce homepage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project uses product data from the Fake Store API and turns it into a dynamic shopping experience with product cards, filters, product options, cart totals, VAT, and a mini-cart interface.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate core front-end development skills through a realistic ecommerce page, including DOM manipulation, API fetching, modular JavaScript, responsive layout, and interactive UI behavior.

## JavaScript Overview

The project separates responsibilities across different JavaScript files:

- `main.js` handles API requests, rendering products, filters, product options, cart UI updates, subtotal, VAT, and mini-cart behavior.
- `cart.js` contains the external add-to-cart request logic.
- `ecommerce.js` contains the ecommerce class structure required for the project.

## Design Direction

The visual style aims for a modern online store look, using:

- A dark premium header
- A soft fashion-store hero background
- Clean product cards
- Grey-blue neutral tones
- Strong but balanced call-to-action buttons
- Subtle shadows, hover states, and rounded UI elements

## Learning Goals

This project was developed step by step to practice and understand:

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS layout and responsive design
- JavaScript functions and events
- Fetching and using API data
- Creating DOM elements dynamically
- Managing cart state in JavaScript
- Working with modules
- Writing readable, commented code
- Using Git and GitHub during development

## Status

The main project requirements are complete. Additional visual and interaction improvements were added to make the page feel more polished and closer to a professional ecommerce homepage.
